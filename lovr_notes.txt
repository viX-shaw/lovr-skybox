LOVR Notes:

Possible to get Model:getNodePose in local space - Easy for comparison and manipulation

lovr.math.quat has functions for smooth rotation transations e,g slerp, check it out

FOr water:
Add foam - white color to vertexes that are above some vertical threshold
           also add when close to camera
		   
		   The wave shape can be made to not cover the entire width of the ocean
		   
Did that, but didn't love the feel - maybe cause it wasn't synced with the wave, maybe needs mulitple noises on diff scales 
									Also, the lighting in VR was not right
